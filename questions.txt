8. Parijat Pushpam: [Joined] 
 Case study:  
1) Increase the cross selling and upselling of a MasterCard product. 
2) At the time when companies come you will have to manage classes as well as ppts 
for multiple companies. I got 6 days of time to research and prepare. 
3) Presentation should look professional first of all. Every slide should be easy to 
explain. Check for grammatical mistakes. Use icons. Make clean ppts. If you have 
won any case competition, then use the template of that PPT. This would save time. 
4) Not very competitive, but still do your best. 
5) That is very subjective. Companies filter candidates on multiple criteria which no 
one would be able to pin point. 
 
 Interview Round 1:  
  1) Was this a technical or a business round? - It was a Business round 
2) Any case study involved - Yes, there was a case study round related to online

2) Was case study involved - No case study 
3) Question asked - Basic HR questions. Not anything new. They wanted to check 
that whether I would be able to work in the corporate environment, given that I 
don't have any experience. 
4) Difficulty of round - It wasn't too difficult. Be calm and give your responses very 
confidently. You should mean what you say obviously. 
 
Suggestion: 
1. Be calm. There will be pressure, but still give your best. 
2. Be very thorough with your CV.

comes to Mastercard and says that their profit is declining heavily. How can 
Mastercard access this bank? Mastercard has data from other banks, how can you 
leverage this data? (Solution from him - there can be competitors, we can do 
competitive analysis, costing analysis if the cost part is affecting the revenue. Using 
data you can build a classification model to get the characteristics of churning 
customers) 
7. Why Mastercard? 
 
Remark: They’re expecting PowerBI and Tableau skills too, case solutions should be small 
and crisp. 
 
Tips: Work on your communication, prepare case studies, business knowledge is very 
important, SQL and Python, Go through ISLR and Josh Strammer, Use GPT to learn 
things

11. Mukul Mundle  
I had 3 years work experience: Assistant Manager - Digital Transformation at Dr. Reddy’s 
Laboratory. Thereafter, worked for 1 year as Business Strategy Manager - Digital Excellence 
at Jubilant Group) 
Pre-interview Case Study:  
We (group of 2) had to provide a strategy on upselling & cross-selling of products for a 
particular bank. We had to describe our strategy and mention what kinds of algorithms we 
would use. Approach: We had to build a recommender system- content based or 
collaborative filtering-based system. I explained both these techniques, and I proposed a 
hybrid solution. We had to submit a ppt. We were given 10-12 days and I spent ~5 hours on 
it. 
 
Round 1: 
It was based on my submitted solution to the case study 
 
We had proposed a hybrid (content+collaborative) solution. Given the profile of customers, 
we would also do some clustering of customers, do market basket analysis, RFM analysis. 
Having implemented the solution, we could go for A/B testing. Since a large dataset was 
involved, I proposed an AWS based solution for implementing this solution. 
 
Their questions: "What's content and collaborative based recommender system, what's A/B 
testing?" 
 
They asked me about a classification project I had done on insurance claims fraud detection. 
They enquired about the exact business problem (An insurance company had received 
various automobile insurance claims and we had to predict whether those claims are 
fraudulent or not). They asked about various columns in the dataset, how I did data 
cleaning, feature engineering, how I addressed the imbalance in the data (they asked about 
SMOTE). They asked about the various models that I had used and finally about the 
performance metric (which was recall in this case).  
 
Round 2:  
Again, questions were asked from the DnS case study.  
They asked the same questions. I explained the problem statement, my approach, etc.

I was further given a case study where mastercard wanted to collaborate with the government 
and so on which different areas could they collaborate with the government and which kinds 
of services to the government could they monetize and how (don't recall exactly) 
 
Further Comments: Since I was mostly focused on preparing for DE Shaw, I didn’t give 
enough time to prepare for Mastercard’s interview. 
 
 
12. Amrita Mandal [Joined] 
● Case study: We were given a case study on customer segmentation and persona 
building for an online platform and finally went to market strategies for each of the 
segments.  
● I used a 50-50 blend of technical and business. I knew that for any kind of 
segmentation that has to be done, clustering has to be performed. Building upon 
that logic made a whole flow from data collection to model building and using the 
insights to develop business strategies to incentivise each group of customers.  
● That was my first company case study, so I took some time to gather my thoughts 
and prepare the plan. I took around a 7-8 days  
● It was moderately competitive. The case study wasn't very tough, with decent 
knowledge and good ppt skills, you can easily make a compelling presentation. 
 
Round 1 :  
1. My round was mostly a conversational round.  
2. The interviewer asked me about the same case study and what my thought process 
was regarding the case study.  
3. Rest was more like a culture fit interview.  
 
Remark: It was a good interview. What worked for me I guess was the communication skills and 
confidence.

Round 1 :  
1. My round was mostly a conversational round. 
2. Tell me something that is not there in your CV 
3. Your academic performance has been on a decline from the 10th grade to 
your B.Tech studies. What do you think might be the reason for this trend? 
4. Do you prefer becoming an expert in a specific field or being a jack of all 
trades? 
5. About case study, approach, and reasoning behind that. 
Round 2: 
1. Walk me through your CV 
2. Work ex Projects 
3. About work at EXL(Interviewer's last company was EXL before 
mastercard) 
4. De sstudy: Outline the strategy for introducing a new credit card in Dubai 
targeted at customers who frequently make everyday purchases. 
 
 
14. Saurabh Kumar 
● Business round, asked around the business of Mastercard 
● Questions asked were very random.  
 
 
15. Utkarsh Sinha 
● The case study was about Customer Acquisition Strategy for ONDC based reward 
credit cards. We had to make a 10 min video explaining our approach to the 
problem.  
●  Parameters of evaluation:  
●  Problem Solving Approach  
●  Novelty of Solution  
●  Analytical Technique  
●  Clarity of Presentation 
● The problem was not very difficult. I approached it based on research about similar 
existing cards.

Round 1:  
Technical round, it involved a case study: to design a recommendation engine for a sports streaming 
platform. Questions were based on GAN architecture, my projects, and statistics. 
 
Knowing what you have written in your CV is a must. Try to cover all the concepts on which people 
in your batch have done projects. I never studied recommendation systems, didn't do any project on 
RSs and obviously it was not mentioned in my CV. Still, the interviewer expected me to know 
everything my batchmates know. So, if possible try to have a glance at the basics of everything.

(BE in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from BITS Pilani, graduated in 2019. Worked 
for 3 years as a Project Engineer at Wipro. Got to work on basic data related projects, involving things 
like EDA and outlier detection, for a year ) 
 
Shortlisting: Although I had put AI Garage higher in my preference, I was shortlisted for DnS 
probably because of my below 7 undergrad CGPA. I did submit the DnS Case Study. It was a 
customer segmentation/analytics case study (You had to assume some data and propose a solution; 
the focus was mostly on the business part). Approach: I looked at spending patterns of customers, 
based on banks’ credit card data - high, medium, and low spenders. High spenders could be ones 
looking for convenience and minimum effort and use their cards on lots of different things (to 
whom we would want to provide features such as no upper limits, tailored more towards no interest 
loan). Medium spenders have a good credit limit but generally use it only when there are big offers 
or promotions (some behavioural strategy to nudge them towards payment).  
 
Round 1:  
No technical question was asked in this round (Interviewer seemed to have little knowledge of 
proper analytics 
1. Asked for a walkthrough of my resume (I started with undergrad and work experience and then I 
moved onto my projects. I highlighted my regression project and asked if she would want me to 
elaborate on this.  She asked assumptions of Linear regression. 
 
2. Case: Platinum card it's been 2 years the credit card spending is low and customer base has not 
increased. How do you make it profitable? (I literally pitched the same solution that I had for the 
DnS case competition, since this was also a customer segmentation case. She was okay with it. She 
was more interested in the customer segmentation approach, not data science aspects) 
3.  Why MasterCard? 
4. How comfortable are you with a client facing role? 
You can go through the annual reports of companies to get an idea about their business (Report 
contains a description in the beginning). 
 
Round 2:  
1. Tell me about ONDC (from the DnS case. I referred to Amazon in my answer)  
2. How will the advent of ONDC impact Amazon in India? (I said Sellers will probably start moving 
to ONDC, but the interviewer expected more. I got stuck here and I feel this was the deciding factor) 
Mastercard D&S 
 
 
 
 
16

In one single Amazon transaction what all ways can Amazon make money? Commission from 
sellers, from Banks for credit card promotions etc 
3. How MasterCard can help the government (I wasn’t confident in my answers here)? 
4. Any other questions? 
Overall there were hardly any technical questions. Develop your business acumen by understanding 
how businesses are able to generate revenue etc.

12. Monal Goel  
 
(B.Tech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kanpur, graduated in 2019. Worked for 2 years as 
Process Engineer [in Operations and Research & Development, majorly on drug development] at 
Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories ) 
 
She had submitted the DnS case study: It was on customer segmentation. There was a platform for 
which a reward system had to be developed. Credit card would give rewards enabling people to 
purchase from that platform. Segmentation had to be done to identify which customer would be 
willing to buy that credit card. We had to research and see which analytics tools could be used. Main 
idea was how we think for a case study. How this business problem could be converted into a data 
science problem. We didn't have to do any coding but had to provide a data science approach to this 
problem.  
 
Her approach: I searched about the platform, developed customer personas (on what criteria their 
buying behaviour depends) and based on that I devised the methodology to target them. I did this 
for both buyers and sellers on the platform. Also decided on the ML techniques, which features to 
select (based on demographics, buying history, platform related details, what are they looking for, 
how we can contact them, what kind of nudges would push them towards buying a credit card : I 
developed features for all of these)

CV shortlisting was done (most probably) 
 
Round 1:  
Lasted 20-30 minutes. (One interviewer) 
It was a technical round  
Case study: Credit card frauds need to be detected. Company has merchants and customers. They 
wanted to develop a graph-based approach to solve this problem. I told them what the features of 
the graph could be - we have nodes & edges, so we could develop a graph structure and how. Then I 
moved to how we could use GNN architecture. Then they asked what are the supervised or 
unsupervised techniques in graphs. I mentioned a few of them. Then we moved forward to 
community detection. They were checking my approach. They didn't ask any proper business 
questions.  
 
Question from a case competition (CV based) : There was a food chain aggregator, and we had to 
help it add on cuisines & customers based on profiles we developed. What K-means, what's 
silhouette score, in which cases k-means fails, what the pre-processing case for k-means, DB-scan?   
 
Questions from projects: They asked about image processing, CNN structure, what's VGG-16, 
what's Resnet, what's the benefit for CNN over MLP, why do we do pooling, what are its key 
advantages? I drew the CNN structure and then they asked questions related to it. They asked about 
receptive fields. 
 
Random Questions : Eigenvalues & vectors, rank of a matrix, SVD and PCA. They wanted to see if 
I knew these concepts and given a matrix, how could I derive these. I could answer these questions. 
 
They asked some questions around my hobbies (which was dancing) 
 
Round 2:  
 
~20 minutes, 1 interviewer 
It was a technical round. No case study was asked: 
 
Project related questions : What's SMOTE, how to use SMOTE, whether and how it can be used 
when we have categorical data? What's regression, what's lasso and ridge, can both be used and in

He had submitted the Dns Case Study: Building a recommendation engine for a mobile application 
of ABC Bank, which will suggest to users different kinds of services provided by the bank. No dataset 
was given, and we were supposed to make a presentation explaining an approach 
 
My idea was to use two kinds of dataset : transaction data & customer profile data. My approach was 
to cluster customer profiles for a particular region, and then I would build a separate 
recommendation engine for each of these segments. I relied on K-means & DBScan for this 
clustering. Regarding customer profile, my chosen variables were : bank balance, credit score, age, 
monthly income, etc. For the transactions dataset, I relied on RFM (total transaction amount, 
monthly frequency, average amount of the transactions, etc. Once I had these customer segments, I 
proceeded to build the recommendation engine, which was built using RFM analysis, which I did 
for each user segment and product/service offered by the bank. Based on this information I found 
relative scores. I then adopted a collaborative filtering approach using these data ; customer 
segments, product/service and corresponding score I had calculated (scaled from 1-10). On the 
technical side, I build the recommendation engine using word-to-vec architecture, along with 
negative sampling and skip-gram model.

Financial knowledge wasn't required as such for this project. I spent 8-10 hours on this project. We 
also had to make a 5 minute video.  
 
Round 1:  
 
Interview lasted ~30 minutes. Given by the director of AI Garage. 
 
I had mentioned 2 terms  - time based maintenance & condition based maintenance - in my work 
experience section. She asked what they meant. Then she moved to my time series project. She asked 
what this project was all about, why did I choose this (S&P 500 index forecasting project).  I said 
investment opportunities that index funds offer. She asked for index fund details. Then she asked 
what's the SARIMAX methodology, what's ADF test, what's stationarity (I had mentioned this 
word in my description), what's strong and weak stationarity, what are ACF & PACF functions, 
Ljung-Box test, how did I make an optimal model selection ( I used the BIC criteria). She asked "Why 
BIC?" I answered that there's a bias-variance tradeoff, BIC prefers a simpler model hence there's a 
higher bias and since I have a small number of observations, I didn't reduce my variance and went 
for bias. 
 
Then she moved to my 2nd project that was regression analysis on customer expenses prediction. 
She asked "What's meant by OLS; what are lasso, ridge and penalty in linear regression; what did I 
choose Lasso & Ridge (since my dataset had interaction among the predictor variables, I decided to 
expand my feature space using polynomial feature expansion, and I did that using degree 2 
polynomial feature expansion. For this, I could either use all features I had and then reduce variance 
ridge, or perform automatic feature selection using Lasso). Then she asked "What's backward feature 
selection?"  
 
Then she moved to my Deep Learning CNN project on assembly line scheduler via image 
classification. She asked: "What's this project all about? What was my basic methodology?" Then she 
asked me to draw the structure of LSTM 
 
Towards the end she moved to my 5th project that was Search Classification (binary classification). 
I had used Active Learning here, and she asked what it was, why did I choose active learning only in 
classification and not regression? (Active learning is based on an uncertainty principle, which can 
only   be described for a classification problem, not a regression problem) I had used RF, Adaboost 
& XGBoost algorithms for this. She asked why only these and not others (I said I had used logistic 
regression, SVM and dec trees as well but those 3 were the top 3 performing). She asked how I 
Mastercard AI Garage 
 
 
 
 
29 
29 
determined the performance (I said F-1 score was my criteria for selection. Active learning is an 
iterative process, I observed the F-1 score trend for training dataset over number of iterations. RF & 
XGBoost performed best here) 
 
~50-60% people cleared this round 
 
Round 2:  
 
~30-35 minutes. Given by an alumnus of Batch 1. 
 
This round was a bit more spicy. The 1st question he asked was "Tell me about an ML/DL algorithm 
that none of your batchmates know?" (I described how I used word2Vec arch to generate graph 
embeddings for a graph with negative sampling using skip-gram model, which I had used in my 
recommendation system project). He asked what my recommendation system project was about; 
what's collaborative filtering, why did I use collaborative filtering, what's meant my nearest 
neighbour graph, how do I construct it, What's the random walk that I've used here, the 2 models of 
Word2Vec architecture, what were my performance metrics (I had used intra-cluster similarity). He 
asked for an alternative approach/metric (I said OLS, he was okay with this). He asked "What's 
meant by eigenvalues and eigenvectors (in this context, he wanted to know a special property that 
when any matrix is multiplied by a vector, it performs a linear transformation involving shift, 
translation and rotation. Eigenvalues are those directions along which there's only scaling, no 
rotation). He asked "What's meant by PCA and SVD?" (PCA was mentioned in my CV and SVD is 
also kinda used in PCA, but this question was being asked to everyone by this panelist). He asked 
"What are the mathematical formulations for SVD & Eigenvalue decomposition as a special case of 
SVD; what's the relationship between SVD and PCA?" (If you look at the formula, SVD used a 
rectangular matrix. In such cases, you compute XTX and XXT, and you compute the correspond 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors for both; it so turns out that eigenvalues for both are same, 
theoretically. He was looking for the UsigmaV(t) formulation basically; in sklearn, after standard 
scaling the entire data, the mean vector becomes 0, so XTX represents nothing but matrix for 
covariance). He asked how my B.tech experience at Kgp was different from PGDBA experience.

 (B.Tech from Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, graduated in 2019. Worked for 3 
years as a Scientist (core electronics) at ISRO) 
 
He did not submit the DnS Case Study 
 
Round 1:  
 
Technical Round, ~25 minutes. All questions from CV.  
 
She started with my regression project and asked similar questions (to BCG): Ridge, Lasso, etc. I 
gave similar answers  
 
Then she moved to my NLP project. Exactly the same questions as in case of BCG.  
 
In my CV, I had a couple of projects on CNN, plus my published paper was also on CNN. She 
asked not much work was being done in image segment in MasterCard. How would I contribute? I 
answered that the basic idea of deep learning is same, whether we are working with CNN, LSTM, 
or anything else. I bring that basic idea to the table. Hence, I can work with any type of neural 
network architecture. I gave examples of other projects that I had on other deep learning methods.   
 
Round 2:  
 
Questions from ML techniques (mostly those mentioned in my CV). What's XGBoost, why is it 
better? What's Word2Vec architecture? He asked me to draw Word2Vec architecture on paper (not 
mentioned in my CV). I drew it, upon which he was pointing at different parts of the drawing and 
asking for basic explanations therein. What's SVM? How is classification different from regression 
in SVM? What are kernels in SVM? How do kernels help with SVM classification? On SVM, I 
answered "Suppose we have two classes, A & B, we can draw a line between them to separate them. 
SVM draws two parallel vectors instead, and it tries to ensure that the 2 classes are on two sides of 
this vector and distance between these 2 vectors (effectively distance between these 2 classes) is 
maximized; In classification, values on either side of these vectors are the classes. In regression 
however, having found these support vectors, we find the hyperplane that passes in between these 2 
support vectors, and the value on this hyperplane gives us regression output; Kernels are used to 
transform data from non-linear high-dimensional set to an easy-to-interpret from. Different types of 
Mastercard AI Garage 
 
 
 
 
31 
31 
kernels are linear, exponential, RBF." He asked "What's RBF?" I said "It's Radial Basis Function. It 
scales our data into infinite dimensions. It's the most used kernel, as we need not specify any 
information prior to applying this kernel, unlike in other kernels where we need to specify the 
dimensions, which may not be easily known always. Hence, RBF is preferred". He asked "Is RBF 
used anywhere else?" I answered :"Kernel is a concept of Mathematics used to transform data from 
an n-dimensional vector space to an m-dimensional vector space." Lastly, he asked, "How good are 
you in programming? How would you rate yourself on a 0-5 scale?" I answered that I am good with 
the logic of a code, so given the syntax, I can put anything into code. So, I rated myself 4/5.  
 
This interviewer had a very fixed set of questions in mind (XGBoost, Word2Vec, SVM; regardless 
of CV), and was expecting a fixed set of answers. There was no guidance in any question in this 
round. He was expecting tech-bookish answers.

Round 1:  
 
Technical Round (~15 minutes) 
It started with my introduction, where I mentioned few of my projects. However, I did not mention 
my recommender system project in my introduction, but they asked questions from it: "What's a 
recommender system, what different types of recommender system did you use, what was its 
ultimate objective?" 
 
Then they asked questions from my regression project. I explained my project. Then they asked 
"What's Regularisation? What is it used for? How is regularisation applied in the context of 
regression? Why is Lasso better that Ridge?" (I explained that regularisation is applied by adding one 
more term in the objective function which also have to be minimized; Lasso can be used for variable 
selection as few of the betas will go exactly to zero)

Tasks I performed were identification of Exogenous variables, Regression Based TS Model, 
ARIMA. 3 Teams won & Shortlisted for Presentation Round. Apart from this, there was 
normal resume based shortlisting. I made some Mistakes in Model creation: Took 
Exogenous variable of same day for which prediction was made. There must be a lag between 
predicting time for exogenous variables.

1. Introduce yourself.  
2. Can you pick any two projects which we can discuss?  
3. Explain the dataset in Financial Health Assessment project. Where did you get the data 
from? How many features were initially present? How did you narrow down the features 
for statistical analysis? Why didn’t you perform the regression on all features and then 
narrow down the features?  
4. What will you do usually when the literature says some features are not related to 
dependent variable - Will you analyze them using statistical techniques to arrive at a 
conclusion or will you simply omit them?   
5. What will you do if you identify that certain variables are significant but the domain 
experts don’t accept it? What is this phenomenon called? What will you do further? 
6. How did you remove multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor? What other 
techniques can be used to address multicollinearity? Are regularization techniques meant for 
removing multicollinearity? How can regularization techniques remove multicollinearity?Is 
overfitting caused by multicollinearity? Is overfitting the only effect of multicollinearity? 
What are the other effects? Will these other effects also be addressed by regularization? If yes, 
How? How to address multicollinearity if we want to keep all the variables? Apart from 
regularization, what are the other ways? 
7. What is the distribution of the dependent variable (Capital Adequacy Ratio) in the 
project? Can we apply Linear regression to any dataset irrespective of the distribution of the 
dependent variable? Will it work on a distribution like Poisson? Is Poisson distribution a 
discrete distribution or continuous distribution? 
8. How do you check the normality of errors/residuals? If normality of errors assumption is 
satisfied, can we apply linear regression? 
9. What are all the other assumptions which need to be satisfied for linear regression?

10. If given a chance, what would you do now with the dependent variable to improve the 
performance? What transformation would you apply on the dependent variable? 
11. What are all the top significant variables which you identified as influencing CAR 
(dependent variable). Explain why ratio of total deposits to total liabilities has a negative 
influence on CAR. 
12. Where does the outliers get identified/segregated in a decision tree? Are decision trees 
robust to outliers? If yes, give 2 reasons for the same. 
13. Explain about the class balancing done as part of Fake Review Detection project. Why 
did you go with under sampling? Why not other techniques? Is there any disadvantage in 
not going with over sampling? How will you balance between the trade-off between 
information loss and performance in over sampling and undersampling? In which cases, will 
over sampling be useful? 
14. Explain Word2Vec. How is it generating word embeddings? And how are those 
embeddings used in the neural network architecture? 
15. Explain why and how you used the LSTM in the project. What is vanishing gradient 
problem? What is the solution to overcome it? 
16. When do we use hierarchical clustering and when do we use k-means clustering? 
17. What are the features which you used in Medical Expense Prediction? Which feature had 
the highest significance? Where did you get the dataset from? In real life scenario, from 
where can the insurance companies get such data? How can the company benefit from this 
model? What is the expense which you have mentioned here? Assume hypothetically that 
you have no constraint on collecting any data. Which other features would you like to collect 
data on and use it in your model to improve the performance? Think and tell about the ways 
in which this medical expense prediction model can be monetized (don’t just constraint 
yourself to the insurance domain. You can think of any business). 
18. What is the difference between error and residual (Think with respect to the observed 
regression line and population regression line)? 
19. Puzzle: You and I and playing a game. There are 100 match sticks. Each person takes 
1/2/3/4 matchsticks at a time and then the other person takes turn. The person who takes 
the last matchstick will lose the game. Tell me a strategy to win this game. Who would you 
want to start the game? 
20. The puzzle was already asked in an interview. So, it must’ve been in your class’s interview 
questions repository. Why didn’t you know that?

De’Shaw had launched a case competition and I was the winner of the competition, so I 
was directly shortlisted for DE Shaw's Final Round 
 
Problem Statement: We (group of 2) had been given mobility index (on daily basis, mobility 
of people coming in an out of shopping malls, theatres, etc.) data for European Market. It 
was a time series data, and we had to find the trend of mobility index. We had 1 week's time 
 
We used 2 approaches: Basic time series approach where we utilized Sarimax & predictive 
modelling approach where we utilized certain exogenous variables (which could impact this 
time series data) and ML models like XGBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, etc. We had 
made a really good presentation.

Round 1: 
 
Tech + Business interview 
 
Case Study: Say, we give you the mobile GPS dataset of people in Kolkata. How will you 
leverage this dataset for De’Shaw? 
 
Approach: We wanted to try finding clusters in this dataset at different locations, and can 
be used for various purposes like opening shopping malls, traffic management and control; 
data could further be sold to government agencies for traffic and infrastructure management 
or to fleet management companies like Ola/Uber. Interviewers were focused more on how 
DE Shaw could directly leverage this dataset. Say, DE Shaw wants to invest in a few 
companies. How could this dataset be monetised further?  
 
Then they moved into my time series project (work experience project). It was about a 
manufacturing unit and daily electricity demand had to be predicted. We had to utilize 
exogenous variables like humidity, temperature, total daily volume, etc. I had used the same 
approach as the De’Shaw Case Comp- Time series (SARIMAX) and ML methods. Their 
questions: "What were the exogenous variables, why did you choose them, should you have 
used more exogenous variables, how doe the SARIMAX model work, how do XGBoost, 
LGBM model work?" 
 
They also gave me a puzzle related to blue and red socks and if we had to get a pair of blue 
and red socks in some combination. It was a probability question. I could solve it (they were 
looking for the methodology). 
 
Round 2:  
 
In my introduction, I had mentioned that I had interest in microeconomics. They asked 
"What's the yield curve, what's recession, hyperinflation?" They asked some questions about 
Indian Monetary Policy. "How are inflation rate and interest rate related to each other." 
 
Case Study: Say, the Indian government wants to open an airport. What should be your 
approach to check the viability of opening that airport. My approach: Look into the 
population, demographic dividend, per-capita income of that area, total number of

50 
50 
passengers travelling by bus/train in the area, is their airport nearby that location, etc. I 
considered all these approaches and provided a solution. They were content with my answer 
 
They asked a question on python, where we had to utilize groupby and pivot commands 
(don't exactly remember the question).  
 
They also asked about k-means clustering and KNN ("What's the overfitting & underfitting 
problem with KNN") ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
16. Ayushman Yadav ((B.Tech from Mechanical Engineering from IIT Guwahati, 
graduated in 2020. Worked for 8 months as a Graduate Engineering Trainee at Reliance 
Jamnagar) 
 
Round 1:  
~ 30 minutes 
They asked for my introduction, and they asked me why did I join PGDBA. I answered that 
I had studied statistics subjects in my bachelors and that's where I developed the relevant 
interest. Then they asked what all statistics related things I had studied in my bachelors, I 
said basic things like p-value and hypothesis testing. For the next 20 minutes, they asked 
questions on hypothesis testing (whatever was taught in the Inference course about 
hypothesis testing [by Amitava sir] were pretty much covered: "there's a coin, you are tossing 
it, you wanna test whether that coin is fair or not. What will your alternate, null hypo be? 
What will your test statistic be? What kind of test will you perform (test of proportion)". (I 
answered all these). Then they gave a question on test of means: "there's a distribution 
generating some data, but you don't know the mean of that distribution, and you have to 
estimate the mean using samples" (Don't remember the exact question, but the solution was 
testing 2 means. I started with null and alternate hypotheses here too).  
 
Then they gave a case study: "Say, you have Domino's data, and last year they had introduced 
a feature of 1 pizza free per pizza ordered on Saturdays. You have  1 year sales data for this. 
Using hypothesis testing, you need to check whether this offer is giving significantly higher

sales on Saturday, and so on.). They asked further: "Using the same data, you wanna see on

(B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur, graduated in 2019. Worked for 37 
months at Tata Steel, 12 Months as Mechanical Maintenance Manager and 25 months in 
Project Management ) 
 
De’Shaw Case Competition: A time series forecasting case competition where we had to 
forecast the mobility index for a masked out European country. We were free to use any 
publicly available dataset. We could use any methodology (the simpler and more informative 
a methodology, the better). There was a leaderboard which showed our model's 
performance on a validation dataset (rankings refreshed once a day).  
 
We had 3-4 days to prepare and submit (in teams of 2). My team cleared the 1st round. Our 
performance on a hidden dataset, how well our code was written, the comments put, ppt 
made, etc. We couldn't win in round 2 due to our poor presentation (top 3 teams were given 
a direct entry into the final round of De’Shaw) 
 
Round 1:  
 
A 2-panelist interview, both of them were PGDBA seniors. (One of them was the judge in 
the final round of my cast comp presentation, where he had asked me a lot of time series 
questions. He didn't ask TS questions in this round to me, but he did so to others). My 
interview lasted 50-55 minutes 
 
It started with my introduction. Then he directly went to the last project in my CV (which 
was on customer segmentation) and started asking questions therefrom: "What did you do 
in this, what kind of dataset did you have, etc." (I had used vehicle insurance policy dataset 
that contained details about different insurance policies for vehicles of different kinds, 
corresponding owner names and details about total coverage amount, total premium paid, 
D. E. Shaw 
 
 
 
 
52 
52 
credit score for each customer, vehicle age, total amount claimed, etc. I used K-means, 
spectral clustering, agglomerative clustering and DBSCAN to identify different clusters, and 
finally I stuck with K-means and spectral since they were giving almost similar results. I used 
the evaluation metric of Silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index as performance metric 
(also WCSS score in case of k-means)). He asked what other categorical variables were there 
(but I didn't have any). Interviewer actually had a very good background in customer 
segmentation. There was a line in my CV about cluster profiling (done after completion of 
clustering). He asked "What exactly did you do in terms of profiling?" (My approach was to 
identify the distribution among claims, number of claims, total premium paid; since the best 
customer for an insurance company is one who pays all the premium and doesn't make any 
claim). He asked "How can you use this information?" (I found one of the 3 clusters to be 
very big, since this was a group of customers who had recently bought their vehicles, and had 
made minimum claims and had paid among the highest premiums. Distribution of vehicle 
age was also small. And for other 2 customers, vehicle age was old; hence I found customer's 
retention ratio was less). He asked a lot of questions on how I found all these things in detail. 
He asked then: "If a driver's score is added, how do you think that will influence things; what 
kind of distribution are you expecting in all 3 clusters identified?"    
 
He then literally put my CV aside and started asking questions: He asked about Pandas, 
PySpark, what exactly is a dataframe, how do you manipulate data, etc. He then gave me 2 
problems to perform data manipulation in Pandas, and then I had to perform the same 
manipulation in SQL (I used MySQL). He was more interested in the exact approach, 
however. I was given a question regarding students attendance dataset and the key was that 
he wanted me to use the CASE statement in SELECT statement, group by, having condition 
and where condition, and there was a non-equi (inequality) join too (2 tables). It was a long 
query, I had to explain the logic. Then I had to implement the same in Pandas.  
 
By another interviewer: "What exactly is meant by linear regression? What are its basic 
assumptions? What will happen if each of these assumptions is violated, and how would you 
rectify that? (I could answer these questions; Chapter 3 of ISLR basically)" 
 
HR questions: "Why do you wanna choose finance and not analytical consulting? Why do 
you think you are better than the rest?" 
 
Round 2:  
D. E. Shaw 
 
 
 
 
53 
53 
 
Again, 2-panel interview. Both of them were our alumni. ~30-35 minutes 
 
I introduced myself. They started with economics and repo rate (I openly said that I have no 
serious background in economics). Then they asked: "What's meant by precision, recall, F-1 
score, F-beta score, where is each of these metrics used, what's AUC score, how do you 
construct AUC curve, how do you find the optimal threshold value using AUC?"   
 
"When can R-square become negative (same as in Mastercard/BCG, same answer)? Why do 
you wanna choose finance over analytical consulting, what's your motivation therein?"  
 
Given a biased dice, with the probability of a face turning up proportional to the number on 
that face, find the probability of ... (3 cases were given, don't recall exactly but question was 
simple; question probably was from Towards Data Science probability page). Then he asked 
the shooting star problem (Towards Data Science again)  (which follows the Poisson 
process). I was able to answer both these questions.  
 
Question from my time series project: Optimal order selection in SARIMAX. "Why did you 
wanna forecast the S&P 500 index? What's ADF test, what are the 3 different types of ADF 
tests? What's the difference between augmented Dickey-Fuller test and Dicky-Fuller test 
(covered in SAAPM)? Say, you're performing backward feature selection and finally you 
rejected 10 variables; how will you check that these were the variables not really required (F
statistic is used for this, it's different version; refer to Chapter 3 of ISLR)." 
 
Round 3:  
 
 
Started with my introduction. A whacky round. They started with my work experience and 
a case: "Given a car, build a model to identify if it will fail in the next  months or not. Which 
features will you use and why?" (I suggested features related to maintenance, time based vs 
condition based maintenance, etc) 
 
"Is there any project you would like to tell us about?" (I had talked a lot about my regression 
and time series project so far, hence I proposed my NLP text classification project) They 
asked "What did you do, why did you choose LSTM and word embedding approach (I said 
word size and memory constraints)? Hypothetically, say you have enough memory. Would 
D. E. Shaw 
 
 
 
 
54 
54 
you still go for this approach? (Basic discussion was around bigrams and ngrams which 
capture the semantic meanings in the words. With them, I could use a count vectorizer, TF
IDF, and other traditional models. However, hypothetically if everything could be fit in 
memory, there would be issues. Statements like "A eats pizza" and "Pizza eats A" would have 
the same set of bigrams and ngrams, hampering the classification). What was the model 
architecture? Why did you use accuracy and F-1 score as performance metrics?" 
 
Then he moved to a puzzle: "5 students are studying under a particular professor who teaches 
PCM. He conducted one test each for students A, B ,C , D & E for each of these subjects. 
He has marks of all 5 for physics and Chemistry but only 4 marks for Chemistry. Fill in this 
missing value." (My basic idea was to compare the marks, which were in the 90s, chemistry 
in 80s and Maths in 70s. Looking at the percentile values, the missing value had 4th rank in 
Physics and Maths so I took the average of 3rd and 5th guy's marks in Chemistry). 
Thereafter, we had back and forth discussion on different approaches to solve this puzzle.

DeShaw Case Competition: 1. Time Series Forecasting - Mobility Index of Europe - Time 
Frame - 2020 to 2022:  
 
2. Finding the right exogenous variables was the key over time series analysis (SARIMA 
models) - About a week 
 
3. Code format was given - brief comments explaining the logic was important. Had to make 
presentation 
 
4. Clarity of your approach, technical knowledge & relevance of business insights 
 
5. Highly competitive, it was a difficult dataset, there was a public leaderboard. Shaw focuses 
more on explainability (so the model should be broadly simpler). I did Random Forest + 
D. E. Shaw

55 
time series (which was something unique). At least 3 slides in the end from a business 
perspective. (I had cleared it) 
 
6. If you don't qualify here, then resume shortlisting was done 
 
Round 1:  
 
Technical Round 
 
Case Study was about a restaurant in Gurgaon. How would you forecast the revenue 
(making use of a list of exogenous variables), and which segments will be affected? My 
approach: First define your scope (what's the time period, revenue channels), then select 
your exogenous variables (variable categories should be MECE, macro level factors should 
be pre -thought. In my case, covid related government restrictions/incentives were 
considered by me; then ask for their thoughts & suggestion on your variables). Every point 
should be backed by logical reasoning.  
 
Other questions: Why do we have a Harmonic mean for F1 score? Basic Macro questions 
(Economics: BDM  & FRM course should be done before holidays) - GDP, recession, 
monetary policies. Python queries related to data manipulation - mostly Pandas NumPypy 
: How do you rate yourself on a scale of 1-10 in python and SQL (rated 8 and 5 respectively): 
dataset has these columns, and how do you extract a certain output 
 
I would rate this round Moderate to Difficult 
 
Round 2:  
 
Non-Technical Round 
 
Case Study: how would you monetise GPS data for Shaw: start with clarifying questions as 
to what exactly is the data, which geography it covers, columns, etc (I had Kolkata’s cars' 
GPS data). Need to identify which sectors/areas are being impacted more. More 
concentration of cars in a region implies more economic activity. Keep asking questions at 
all levels and it should be conversational. Next, I thought of insurance (a car which is moving 
a lot is important for insurance companies), and so on. Case discussion lasted for 45 minutes. 
No analytics

Other questions: Questions were related to project and mostly on business applications : I 
had done 3 individual projects in IIM C, one was AirBNB listing price regression project. 
He asked me to assume a hotel was far from the airport. Would this affect its pricing? ( he 
tried to prove my approach wrong, and he did succeed somewhat.) I agreed that I should 
have incorporated his concerns in my model. He wanted to check how broad was your 
thinking, and if nudged in the right direction, did you follow along 
 
I would rate this round  Moderate 
 
3rd Round:  
 
HR Round. They asked: “If we roll out the offer, will you accept it?” 
 
 My overall experience was Excellent, one of the best interview experiences. Know 
everything about how Shaw operates. Have good hold on Regression & Time series.  I had 
pre prepared my mindset before the interview. I used to think a lot about exogenous variables 
and how I would monetise them. PPT skills are very important ( need to prepare a decent 
one quickly) 
 
Rohan’s Preparation Strategy: Started preparing while creating the CV. Projects are most 
important. 50% prep was done with CV prep. Next, identified broad topics (regression, time 
series, deep, etc.). Studies regression from ISLR (2 & 3) and Montgomery book, time series 
(SPA link) focused on practical learning via projects wrt time series. ML models from ISLR 
and statquest videos (thoroughly) and IIM C (Business Data Mining course), Deep Learning 
IIT KGP (Sudeshna Sarkar slides (topics only) and Mitesh Khapra YT videos, and IIT KGP 
book is also good). Didn't attend deep learning classes in KGP (prof taught that poorly), 
Kaggle project is imp.  
 
Inference is most important for statistics. Studied mostly in ISI semester. Imp are CI, Hypo 
testing, A/B testing, p-interval, power of Test (we could be asked to design our own 
hypothesis in interviews : null, alt, etc.)

Case prep: IIM Bangalore case book is very good. Data Science cases are different in the sense 
that you have to decide on a broad model, which data (attributes) to collect and so on. GDs 
help a lot here.  
 
Max 4 case comps in CV. Data manipulation is very imp (Pandas)

Clarifying question by Prakhar : which city you are talking about, how many 
hospitals, give us old data, people come in hospital for which reason,  
Ans given by interviewer: covid period 2021, 
Ans given by Prakhar: So  people might come for vaccinate, people post covid 
symptom people,covid cases, normal patients 
Question asked by interviewer: Tell me about possible exogenous variables 
Hint by interviewer: No of people that took insurance in that city so from that your 
footfall will vary or not? 
Ans by Prakhar: Insurance data might be helpful so those who have taken insurance 
will go more 
Hint by interviewer: Govt has given a health scheme so what might be the impact of 
it. Will that have a positive response or negative?  
 
Interviewers have given many subtle hints and factors and asked whether it might 
have an impact or not. Total 45 minutes interview. Whole round about structure your

Taken by Ankita jha: Purely technical 
1. Project (asked about terms) specifically highlighted terms  
2. Case: Supposingly you want to open new airport how would you select city what all 
parameter you would consider 
 Answer - population, income, frequency of travel, nearest airport 
3. Hypothesis testing: You have to test whether citizen of US is spending more that 8k you 
have to test that 
Prakhar’s Approach: Started by selecting Null hypothesis, alternate hypothesis, How would 
he collect the data  
How data collection would happen = stratified sampling, In stratified sampling they wanted 
to know the number of people to take an interview. They wanted to hear it should be greater 
than 30. They wanted to hear T-statistic, p-value 
4. Make graph of income expenditure in USA. 
 
Very basic que of hypothesis testing were asked, very specific technical aspect of terms 
mentioned in cv were asked.

11. Mukul Mundle (B.Tech + M.Tech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kanpur, graduated in 
2018. Worked for 3 years as Assistant Manager - Digital Transformation at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratory. 
Thereafter, worked for 1 year as Business Strategy Manager - Digital Excellence at Jubilant Group)  
 
Round 1:  
 
Online Round (there were network issues during this round) 
 
They were mostly asking questions randomly 
 
They asked questions on Boruta ("It's a feature selection technique, which is applied above the RF, 
Gradient Boosting techniques which helps select features"). 
 
They asked "What's the problem of multicollinearity and how will you handle it?" (I answered that 
we could use VIF). I had mentioned Shapley values in my resume. He asked "How would you utilize 
Shapley values after building any ML model?" (It works on the game theory approach, and it will 
provide ranking on features with their positive and negative impact on our target variable, and they 
also give information about the design space. They are used above the ML models). 
 
Then they asked a question on graph neural network (this was driven by their role and its demands). 
I had done my FADML project on Graph Neural Network (not mentioned in my CV), where we 
had different compounds (their formula, indicating elements and bonds) and we had to predict 
whether these molecules were inhibiting the HIV virus or not. We visualized elements as nodes, and 
bonds connecting them as edges, and approach this as a graph neural network problem. We could 
utilize a transformer kind of algorithm to solve this problem. They asked how attention would be 
used for this graph neural network. The discussion went deep into graph neural networks. I gave an 
answer accordingly, but they weren't particularly satisfied with it. (Last year they had not asked these 
questions, so this was a complete surprise!) 
 
They also asked some questions on python related to string reversal (I could do that; can't recall the 
other questions, but they were related to data structures). They had their own platform where we 
had to code these questions.

Round 1:  
 
What is Regression? 
What are the assumptions of regression? 
What is correlation? 
For a line y=mx+c, what is the correlation? 
I had a project on NLP, asked what Embedding is, how I go about the project. 
Asked me some basic probability questions 
Asked me about distributions 
 
Basic understanding of all concepts would be sufficient to clear R1, R2 requires you to think 
critically, questions varied from graph networks to bayesian inference.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
14. Srivatsa Kulkarni (BE in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from BITS Pilani, 
graduated in 2019. Worked for 3 years as a Project Engineer at Wipro. Got to work on basic data 
related projects, involving things like EDA and outlier detection, for a year ) 
 
Round 1:  
 
The interviews conducted by this firm was very random. Many were asked to code using oops in 
python etc. 
 
 1. Asked for intro and then began with SQL query based on joins and group by. Since I had 
worked in backend development asked whether I know ML model deployment.  
 
 2. Asked to implement the gradient descent algorithm from scratch (python 
implementation part). I explained the gradient descent algorithm and since we cannot use py-torch 
etc for the case of simple linear regression I told him we can directly compute the derivatives and use 
them to update the beta0 and beta1. He seemed satisfied with this. 
 
 3. Asked to write the formula for Beta estimate using normal equation and then write numpy 
code for implementing the same (on pen and paper) 
 4. He asked me to write the logistic loss function and asked me to write the equation of 
Bernoulli distribution and plot its PMF. 
 
Providence 
 
 
 
 
74 
74 
 5. Asked to explain normal distribution and to write down its formula. He also asked 
something on the lines of “Derive the least squares expression using normal distribution.” 
 
 6. I had a project on NLP using BERT, so he asked me what is the max value of sigmoid 
derivative and asked me to draw the architecture of transformer and explain attention, equations of 
self-attention & its working,  and why use feed forward network. (He was cross questioning me as I 
was drawing the architecture) 
 
 7. I had worked on parallel-processing, asked to write a code to parallelize computing mean, 
std-dev etc on a large dataset. (question was picked from my work experience; they were insisting on 
writing the code) 
 
Round 2:  
 
1. He directly began with a graph problem, where we are given traffic congestion data for different 
time points for different nodes. How will you optimize the traffic flow? I came up with some 
approach but he wasn't satisfied. 
 
2.  He gave another graph problem where using age, weight, height, BMI we need to predict some 
output and the features have a causal structure. How will you utilize this causal structure for 
prediction? Since the features are linked the edge weights could be the correlation strength between 
the two and this would imply that we might have multicollinearity issues. We may have to use PCA 
to decorrelate the features. He asked to explain PCA and why eigenvectors are orthonormal. He was 
ok with the approach but more importantly he wanted me to approach it using Bayesian inference 
(I later asked him about the approach) 
 
3. He saw my DL project and asked to explain it, how fine tuning was done. Then he gave a problem, 
we are given patient notes and we need to build a model which will be able to answer general 
questions about the prescription of a patient.  
 
Round 3:  
 
1. Asked the meaning of my name and then a detailed introduction.  
 
Providence

2. He was quite focused on my work experience. He asked about my proud moment in my work-ex, 
drilled on it. 
 
3. Why did I join Wipro? Why not some other firm? 
 
4. What is the most important thing you gained in your previous organization? 
 
5. Why Providence? Why this role? 
 
Be thorough with derivations, basic formulas of all the PDF, knowledge of DL and Bayesian 
inference on graphs (must have). Be thorough with advanced SQL. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(B.Tech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kanpur, graduated in 2019. Worked for 2 years as 
Process Engineer [in Operations and Research & Development, majorly on drug development] at 
Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories) 
 
Coding Round:  There were 11 questions. 8 MCQs [Probability (Bayes’ theorem, expectation), 
ML concepts (akin to case comps)].  
 
One Regression/Classification problem having 3 parts 
1st Coding Question : Data Manipulation (using Pandas), joining tables, finding aggregate values, 
changing data types, making 1 dataframe from these multiple sources 
2nd Coding Question : Data preprocessing _ Data splitting, imputation, etc. 
3rd Question : Model Fitting and checking results 
 
We couldn't copy paste from any source. Questions were easy but time was a concern (1.5 hours) 
 
Look up Pandas manipulation; assignments and case competitions would suffice. Don't get into the 
habit of copying codes. I would rate it 3/5.  
 
Everybody applied and 15-16 were shortlisted based solely on this test 
 
Round 1:  
 
20-30 minutes 
 
It was a technical round 
 
Started with a case study. A company's sales were not doing well and I was asked to find the reasons 
behind this. I had to start from the business perspective, then I had to ask for data (what all features 
I would need to solve this problem) and then moved towards forecasting. My approach : I started 
with exploring if it's a demand or supply problem by asking questions. They said it was a supply side 
issue. Then I moved into exploring as to in which part of the value chain the problem could lie. At 
one point in the case study, I was told that none of the things that I had pointed out so far was the 
problem. The company had multiple SKUs. It was a stocking problem. They wanted me to forecast 
BCG 
 
 
 
 
88 
88 
why there’s a stocking problem. The company's operations were pan India.  They wanted me to 
forecast the stocking. I looked into the features and came up with a SARIMAX model. They asked  
what's 'X’ in  SARIMAX model. I said it refers to the exogenous variables and they asked me what 
exogenous variables I would take. 
 
They asked me a question from my work experience’s project (it was analytics related). No business 
question was asked to me in this round 
 
Round 2:  
 
 It was business round (partner round) 
 
Business case study : There was a company into water tanks. There was no growth in this market, 
and they wanted to move to another industry. I had to find which industry they could enter into. 
I started by asking questions which would help me understand exactly why they wanted to switch 
into another industry and what was the current scenario of the market. I looked into what are the 
current core competencies of the company, and I realised their distribution channel is strong which 
should be leveraged. Then I analysed some synergies with various other industries and how that can 
be bundled with the current product. Then I delved deeper into how they could go about building 
a USP. 
 
Questions on my academic performance : I had mentioned in my CV that I had scored the highest 
overall marks in ISI semester (you get a scholarship based on that). They asked me which courses 
were there in ISI, how I did in KGP semester and my current overall rank (although it was mentioned 
in my CV). They seemed quite happy with the answers 
 
Round 3:  
 
HR round.  “What was your previous job like, how hectic was it?” Then they gave me a scenario that 
BCG usually works for 16 hours a day and if I could manage that, with justification. I gave them the 
example of my PGDBA experience - despite coming from a non-analytics background, I was holding 
the 1st rank in PGDBA, which illustrates that I could work hard and manage the technical & other 
aspects pretty well too. 
 
 
BCG

89 
BCG interviews weren't pressure interviews as such. They were directing us as and when needed. 
They wanted to check whether we can answer all questions or not and if not, are we able to pick up 
their nudges and move in the right direction 
 
Monal’s Preparation Strategy: I started preparing 1.5 months before the placements. I started 
with  business case studies (from IIM A book). Then I moved into ML concepts (read ISLR twice). 
I focused on Deep Learning (as I was interested in AI Garage).  I brushed up on ML concepts. I did 
the bare minimum wrt classes this time.  
 
Materials for case questions: IIM A case book, IIM Lucknow's channels, BCG Gamma online case 
studies. 
 
Materials for ML concepts : Course slides, ISLR, medium (mostly for Deep Learning), spark by 
examples website (for Big Data), For doubts : Gooldfellow's book and Youtube channels (statquest, 
Zed statistics, jbstatistics, ritwik maths). I found UDK rather superficial.  
 
Towards the end, I used to pick one algo from my resume and think in what different ways it could 
fail and how I could address that 
 
Important subjects : CDS, Inference, SPA (for initial rounds and puzzles), Deep Learning, Big Data 
(if you have taken the elective and mentioned so in your resume), basic idea of algorithms 
 
General tips : Start with the ML concepts from your CV. For the projects mentioned on your 
resume, be thorough with all concepts, which other models can be used for similar problem 
statements, what are the current flaws in your problem and how you can improve it.

Coding Round: 11 questions, 3 based on modelling, 8 MCQs on basic data science and Probability
Statistics (higher level than Case comp questions). Modelling question: Datasets with drivers and 
vehicle information. 1st we had to collect data from different tables and merge them (joining 
dataframes based on keys). This was doable but lengthy, so I skipped it. 2nd question was about data 
preprocessing (missing values, etc.). There was a column on age with missing values, which we had 
to fill with mean. There were 2 categorical columns that we had to label encode. 3rd question was 
on model building. Easiest of the three. We had to come up with a model that maximized recall for 
the dataset. I used a Random Forest Classifier and that worked well.  
 
It was a proper Data Science coding round. We could also use the internet (sans whatsapp & 
ChatGPT). There were some limits on the time and space the code could take/consume. 
 
Round 1:  
 
~30 minutes. Business Case Round: There's a hotel chain in Sydney, and they are struggling to 
meet their profit targets and their profits are declining since the last few months. They have hired 
you. Analyze the situation (very open ended). 
 
I started by asking questions: Is this a revenue side or cost side problem, are they paying more (than 
industry standards) to their employees, are the raw material costs going up, etc on the cost side and 
what are the different revenue channels for the hotel. Interviewer then mentioned that it's a revenue 
side problem and asked me to list down different methods a hotel can generate revenue from. Main 
source: room charges, 2nd channel is restaurant (I was thinking out loud, interviewer was nudging 
in preferred directions). Interviewer then asked how would you collect data (from whom) for each 
of these revenue channels. Then he asked how would you quantify these revenue channels. [X 
number of rooms, avg cost and occupancy of each room; I answered likewise for all channels]. I 
Whenever I asked a not-so-relevant question (like "Is it a 3-star or a 5-star hotel"), the interviewer 
counter-questioned me asking why would I need this information, how would it impact my analysis 
 
There was no solution as such to this case. The interviewer was looking for the way we know what 
data to extract and how we can extract it.  
 
Fit question: "If you take you back to August 2024, when you had joined the course, what would 
you do differently?" I had mentioned in my interview that I used to read lots of business articles 
during Covid, which sparked my interest in analytics. I mentioned that I had stopped that after 
BCG 
 
 
 
 
91 
91 
joining PGDBA. If I could go back, I would probably continue reading those articles. Then they 
asked "Is there any course you didn't like and would want to be removed from PGDBA?" I said SSD 
(in flow) but to justify, I said the topics covered in SSD were some sort of a combination between 
SPA and Inference. Hence, SSD became quite repetitive. 
 
Round 2:  
 
Technical Round (~30 mins)  
 
CV based round. The interviewer was focused on the words highlighted (in bold) in our CV and he 
was most interested in the business impact of the projects. My regression project was on flight price 
prediction, and the first question that he asked was "Why would you want to do Flight Price 
Prediction?" He further asked "What is boosting, what different boosting methods do you know, 
why XGBoost is better than other boosting methods, what are the hyperparameters of XGBoost?" 
(I listed around 4-5 hyperparameters, regularization params, gamma, learning rate, number of trees 
to be used, depth of the tree, etc; I gave an example comparing Adaboost with XGBoost algorithm). 
Only cross question herein: I had mentioned that RF is better in adapting to the data than XGBoost; 
while I had no particular answer to this, I said something related to how the recall parameters of RF 
adapt to data better (no definite answer to this). I had mentioned OLS, Ridge and Lasso. He asked 
why 3 different models (I answered: OLS is the base model, Lasso helps with variable selection and 
Ridge helps prevent overfitting in the data). He further asked "What's Ridge regression, what's Lasso 
Regression, do they have any drawbacks'' 
 
Then he moved to the NLP Project. I had mentioned "Helpfulness of Review" there. He asked what 
it meant. (Basically, reviews on any ecommerce site cannot be ranked based on the rating therein - a 
1 star review could be as important as a 5 stars review. So, reviews should be ranked based on 
information they provide to customer. Helpfulness is defined thusly - for each product, take the 
number of reviews each product gets and normalize that with the number of reviews the product 
has). Further question were on lemmatizater" What's lemmatizer, why do use a lemmatizer (to 
handle different forms of the same verb, it ensures that root form of the word is maintained), why 
not stemming (while lemmatizer all forms to the root word, while stemming will convert all forms 
to a root words which may not be the dictionary root word). I had used TF-IDF as a word vectorizer, 
so he asked about Word vectorization: what's word word vectorization, which different 
vectorization techniques do you know (count, Word2Vec, TF-IDF). He asked in detail about TF
BCG 
 
 
 
 
92 
92 
IDF (which I had used in my project): What's TF-IDF, what's the difference between TF & IDF 
herein 
 
Some general questions based on key terms in my CV: “what are the different metrics do you know 
(I answered Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-score), what's the difference between precision and 
recall (I gave an example of UPI transactions, where we look for precision and bank loan 
disbursements, where we look for recall), when do you use which one, why is accuracy not always a 
good measure (not good for imbalanced dataset).” 
 
Round 3:  
 
More of a Formality, Case+Fit round 
 
They started with "Why do you want to join a Consulting firm". In my introduction, I had 
mentioned that I had been brought up in various cities, and I liked travelling. Accordingly, I 
answered that I would like to continue travelling and consulting firms would hence be an ideal 
choice for me, as I would be travelling to prime locations, meeting new people and taking up new 
jobs. And if I must be in a consulting firm, I'd rather be in a leading firm like BCG. 
 
Then they asked "Why did you leave your previous job?" Again, in my introduction, I mentioned 
why I joined PGDBA, and the reason was that I had a background in Deep Learning from B.Tech 
days itself and during Covid, I had read many articles on how Businesses were being transformed 
using data. I wanted to work in this field, hence I quit my job. 
 
Then we moved to the case: There's Apollo pharmacy in USA, and they have a system wherein a 
patient goes to doctor who prescribes a medicine over a network which goes to a server, and through 
that server the customer can choose which pharmacy he/she wants to purchase the medicine from. 
Usually, patients usually prefer pharmacies close to their homes/offices. Relevant information is 
passed onto the pharmacy of the patients' choice, and a date is assigned for the customer to visit the 
pharmacy and pickup the medicine. However, they are facing an  issue that the medicine is packed 
and ready but the customer doesn't show up (Over the Counter money issue - since the medicine is 
just lying ready, over the counter, to be sold). They asked me to analyze the situation, and how would 
I promote the patients to show up and buy the medicines. (I was not expecting such a case!) I started 
asking questions on the processes through which these pharmacies were allotted to the customers., 
Maybe there's an issue that the allotted pharmacy is to far from the customer. However, interviewers 
BCG 
 
 
 
 
93 
93 
answered that this wasn't an issue, as customers could choose the pharmacy. Then I started asking 
questions that would help me profile the customers who don't show up (maybe young people aren't 
very serious wrt taking medicines). They asked what factors besides age could affect a patient's 
decision to buy medicines. I answered if a customer is regularly visiting the doctor, we'll probably 
have past medical history of that patient, through which we can see for what kind of diseases people 
usually buy medicines for. Then they asked "Suppose you can do this kind of profiling and predict 
whether a customer will buy a certain medicine or not. What will you do thereafter?" I answered that 
if our model predicts that customer is not going to show up, we need not keep those medicines 
packed." Then they countered: "What if the customer actually shows up contrary to the model's 
prediction? What will you do?" I answered that this is a supply chain issue, a kind of back-ordering. 
Companies regularly deal with such issues. Then the interviewer asked "Can you think of some other 
way in which you can promote the sale of medicines?" I answered: "Apollo Pharmacy has its mobile 
app. We can send reminders (notification/nudges) to customers to buy the medicines. We can share 
articles/information about the negative effects of the disease(s) the customer is facing, and how 
important taking that medicine is." Interviewer was satisfied with this answer and the case ended 
here. 
 
Then he again asked those questions around “Why did you leave your job?” and the interview ended 
there. 
 
Anurag’s Preparation Strategy: I had attended almost every single lecture, so most of my 
preparation happened while paying attention in class, particularly in courses like inference & CDS.  
 
I started preparing for the interviews since the last week of the 1-month vacation. For technical 
revision, the only book that I read was ISLR. I used to watch a ot of YouTube videos, particularly 
StatQuest. I had an advantage wrt Deep Learning since I was already familiar with them simce by 
B.Tech days. For case studies, I saw the different frameworks used in different types of case studies 
from the IIM Calcutta Consulting Club's handbook. I didn't solve any particular case as such. 
Remember that any case should primarily be approached from the business side, and only then 
should you move to the modelling part (which is anyway the easier part) 
 
I focused a lot on how I wanted to tell a story around each project. So, I had prepared 3-4 lines on 
the business aspect of each project. When asked to walk though any project of mine, I used to devote 
a 1st 3-4 lines on just the business impact, sans any technical information. After these 3-4 lines I'd 
BCG

dive into the details. For preparing answers for you group project topics, I'd recommend you sit with 
your groups and discuss the answers. 
 
Revise Inference, SQL, FAD (time and space complexity part for BCG's coding round), Big Data, 
Deep Learning, Business Data Mining (BDM course itself is a revision). Courses that HRM and 
Strategic Management could help in HR rounds.

(B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur, graduated in 2019. Worked for 37 months 
at Tata Steel, 12 Months as Mechanical Maintenance Manager and 25 months in Project 
Management ) 
 
Coding Round: There were 5 questions from basic ML & stats concepts; coding test was on data 
manipulation. Basically, using pandas, numpy & sklearn, we had to perform different kinds of joins, 
merges, column renaming, aggregations (groupby), apply functions, etc. 
 
Problem statement: 3 different coding questions. Housing datasets in 1st where we had to read 4 csv 
files, there were technical mistakes in column names which we had to correct based on given 
description, we had to calculate several metrics; 2nd questions involved datetime manipulation 3rd 
question was model fitting: we had to fit a very simple regression model (I used RF regressor). 
Evaluation was based on accuracy, time complexity and how well the code was written. 
 
Total duration was 1 hour. Only 20 students in the entire batch could clear this preliminary round. 
I would suggest go through Pandas documentation 
 
Round 1:  
 
Technical Round. ~20-25 minutes 
 
Nothing related to CV was asked. Questions related to basic statistics and ML algorithms  
 
"What's meant by PCA? There are 2 variables related to a 3rd variable (A, B with C). You need to 
regress A&B, which are correlated to each other strongly, on C. You cannot drop any variable. How 
BCG 
 
 
 
 
95 
95 
will you do this?" (I approached it using PCR and I how I would complete alpha and beta vectors 
therein)" He then asked for another approach (standard approach to handle any multicollinearity; 
it's called error bases correction; basic idea is that all predictor variables are regressed on the variable 
having high multicollinearity, and then we build a model and compute the errors made by this 
model). This was a tricky question and took a while. Interviewer asked to describe both approaches 
in brief ("How will you solve it, how will you get the coefficient estimates, etc") 
 
"What's the difference between PySpark and python? (I had big data as an elective). Define precision, 
recall and give an intuitive understanding of both these ideas (If a model has a very high precision, 
then i can rely on that model to correctly identify the positive classes; high recall implies it will make 
very few mistakes in identifying the positive cases). What is the difference between outliers and 
leverage points in regression's context? Why is it important to identify these points, and how would 
you do it? How do outliers and leverage points affect our model (sigma sq estimated will be deviated 
from the actual if outliers are present)? What's exactly Lasso? Why does it do variable selection? Why 
does Ridge prevent overfitting? (ISLR answers this very well). R2 for linear regression is properly 
defined, but we can still define R2 if we do not have a linear regression; what's the catch therein? 
(TSS=SSR+SSE doesn't hold true it's not an OLS linear regression, and hence R2 may turn out to 
be negative) 
 
Round 2:  
 
Case study round, given by a partner. ~30 minutes 
 
An optimisation case study: Company "A" was producing product "P" and I had to maximise its 
total sales in revenue (via total units sold) and also minimize costs. Dataset was available 
 
Approach: You had to form the constraints using regression and optimum function using cost 
analysis, and use any optimisation technique thereafter. However, I made the mistake of directly 
starting with the questions, while the interviewer expected me to ask more questions on the dataset. 
[I started preparing seriously for case studies after this round! There's a very good book: "Case in 
Point. Complete Interview Case Preparation". It's the source of all casebooks. Use this casebook for 
preparing the different types of formats and use IIM A's casebook for practice]. Geeks for Geeks has 
a very good page for puzzles. 
 
Round 3:  
BCG 
 
 
 
 
96 
96 
 
Another partner round. ~30-35 minutes 
 
It started with my introduction. Then he asked "Why do you wanna do consulting; why did you 
choose this over other options in analytics? Was there any kind of analytics involved in my work 
experience (I said no right away)? Having done the PGDBA programme, can you think of any 
improvements you could have done to work work experience? Where could you have applied 
analytics in your job?" 
 
He then moved to my Assembly Line Scheduler project, where I had build an end-to-end ML model 
which picked the image of a product and using graph, it identified which manufacturing stage the 
product is currently in and schedules it accordingly for further processing. Questions: "How did you 
approach this? How did you get data for this project (I used solidworks to create a trading model 
and extracted images therein) 
 
Case: There's a pharmacy chain "I" in a country with a rule that doctors must ask the patients 
regarding their nearest pharmacy while writing the prescription. Each pharmacy has a unique ID 
number. The prescription is used to share a mail to the pharmacy about the patient's requirements. 
Pharmacy packs medicines in a box-package. Problem was that despite being assigned so by the 
prescription, patients weren't turning up to receive the medicine.  
 
Basic approach: what kind of sources do patients have of collecting the medicine. There was no 
online source and the patient won't acquire it from any other pharmacy as the name suggested by 
him/her is the most accessible pharmacy for him/her. (This much was clear after I asked a couple of 
questions). Solution: Doctors prescribing the medication weren't really motivating the patient to 
take the medicine. Attitude of patients was another issue. Yet another issue was the severity of the 
disease which would obviously affect their motivation. For minor cases like fever, patients generally 
didn't bother. They asked me if I built a classification model to identify whether a patient will pick 
the medicine or not, then the model would give a certain set of predictions. How would I identify 
the most crucial set of patients to call and which to not call. I said we could sort patients by highest 
probability and use a Gantt chart to identify a threshold and hence call the number of patients as per 
my budget.

Coding Round: Test was for 1.5 hours. Three coding questions and a couple of MCQs on 
Probability, ML concepts. Attempt the coding questions first, MCQ's are relatively easy, hardly 
should take 15 minutes.  Practice pandas[ merging, removing null values, imputation], basic model 
fitting syntax from sklearn. Attempt and get right two out of three coding questions 
 
Round 1:  
 
Technical Interview 
 
1. Explain how SHAP works : They were expecting more than a surface level answer. They wanted 
to know in depth how exactly it works. I Had mentioned it in the resume as a project.  
 
2. Are explainability and interpretability the same ? : extension of SHAP, which is used for 
explainability. He was confused ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
13. Amrita Mandal  
Coding Round: The coding round consisted of case-based questions. There were 4 big coding 
situation based questions which could be solved by basic knowledge of pandas and basic machine 
learning packages. The name of the game was speed and clarity. They wanted to know how Swift is 
with your coding skills. I didn't us much resource, if you had done enough college projects and built 
simple machine learning regression and classification projects , you're good to go 
 
Round 1:  
It was a business case study. My client is a pain India retail company. And they wanted to know why 
their profit was decreasing. I don't remember it completely but the final problem boiled down to 
that the client was facing demand forecasting issues and they were over estimating the quantity to be 
sold and their actual quantity sold was lesser because of which there was over inventory and they 
were facing losses. Now tackle the problem by suggesting sophisticated demand forecasting 
techniques like time series analysis.  
 
Remark: Read a lot of case studies and get both technical and business understanding of the cases.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15. Aishwary Srivastava: 
 
Pre-round 1: Coding test 
 
Interview Round1(Tech round): 
  
1. You got two variables, pressure and temperature and machine performance is dependent on both, 
both are correlated, how will you remove collinearity & which model you will apply to predict 
performance of the machine 
2. Terms about Deep learning  
3. You're in a hospital and your model failed to predict the cancer. Calculate false cancer detection 
cost. You have to work on precision and recall 
4. Five six hyperparameters of XGboost 
5. Max depth of Xgboost? 
6.In case of overfitting you will increase or decrease the depth of XGBoost 
  
Interview Round 2(Analytics case round): 
  
Case 1: False claim happened in insurance, you have insurance data, you need to reduce the number 
of false claims without affecting good consumers (those have claim actually) 
  
Case 2:You are a sales manager, the rewards depend on the amount the salesperson does, the 
reward could be any form, you need to find out which reward contributed how much to the 
employee. For example if you do 15k sales you would get hawkins coupons, if you do 75k sales, 
suppose there is another person who already has iphone you tell him that do 75k sale you will get 
iphone, that is not contributing much , but if you will tell him you will get holiday offer that will 
get actual incentive, you need to find out/segregate which reward is actually contribution to 
employee sale.

4. Emayavaramban A [Joined] 
  
 The interview process had four rounds. First online test to shortlist the candidates followed 
by two technical rounds. Five people made to final round where you have a VC with top 
management from USA and India 
 
Pre-round:  
 Pre-round is an online test, where we are tested on ML basics and coding 
acumen. The shortlisting criteria for second and third rounds seems to be your grasp on 
basics on ML and AI. Final round selection criteria is whether you can prove that you are 
culturally fit for the company 
 
Round 1: 
 The test was for one hour(or 1.5 hrs, not sure). The questions were designed to test 
the ML and AI basics, coding skills and problem solving skills in general. There is no specific 
way to prepare for the test. If you are preparing well for placements in general, you will be 
able to clear this round 
 
Interview Round 1: 
 For me, first round was taken by Data Science Manager, whom I have seen in the 
company's Pre Placement Talk. So I called her by her name, instead of calling ma'am. She 
WWT 
 
 
 
 
104 
104 
actually appreciated it saying 'Finally someone calls by my name' (they don't expect 
candidates to be formal just for the sake of it). The interview was about my resume projects 
and ML basics(when would you use F1 score instead of accuracy, explain some algos 
mentioned in resume). I was given a problem on probability. I was stuck in the middle of 
solving it and she helped me out as well. 
 
Interview Round 2:  
 Second round was taken by a relatively young employee of the 
organization(whom later I learned is one of the best data scientists they have right 
now). He wanted to know whether I have proper coding knowledge. I told him 'To 
be honest, I am not the best coder you will meet today. But I can give you an 
approach to solve any coding problem'. I was given some problems and I answered 
them correctly 
Problem 1: You have 9 balls and one of them is slightly heavier than other balls. You 
have a measuring balance to weigh them. What is the minimum steps in which you 
will find the heavier ball?  
Answer:2 
 
Problem 2: A person walks 10 km south, 10 km east and then 10 km north. He ends 
up in the same place he started. How is this possible? Ans: He is standing in the 
North Pole. Problem 2 contd: Is that the only possible answer?  
Ans: I told that if he is standing at any point in a circle of 10km radius with south 
pole as centre, it will satisfy this condition as well) 
 
Then I was told to explain BERT in python code (how would you train BERT on 
your dataset, how would you run the model). I was also asked questions on other 
resume projects and ML/AI basics 
 
Interview Round 3: 
  
1. Third round is a video call with top management.  
2. WWT India's head along with two top managers from USA had a call with me. 
3. They introduced themselves one by one and asked me to introduce myself. I was the 
last candidate to be interviewed so I said 'First of all, Thank you everyone for 
patiently introducing yourself.  
WWT 
 
 
 
 
105 
105 
4. As I understand, I am the last candidate and you guys must be pretty tired of 
repeating yourself again and again' This immediately put a smile on their faces and 
my interview was smooth sailing from there.  
5. They asked about my previous work ex, why do you want to change your career 
track, what made you passionate about data analytics, do you know what does a 
normal day of a Data Science Consultant look like, what do you do in your free 
time(They also go through your resume on what you have mentioned under 
'Interests'. 
6.  They asked me why did you mention Creative Writing as your interest and I told 
them I write poetry and short stories and I also narrated a science fiction story I was 
writing) 
  
  
General suggestions:  
 
1. WWT expects candidates to be genuine. If you are truly passionate about data     
analytics and you can prove the same in the interview, you have higher chance of 
getting hired. They expect people to have a clear understanding of basics and also 
expect them to have good problem solving skills.  
2. They don't want to hire people who have mentioned fancy terms in resume just for 
the sake of it ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
4. Diwakar 
1. Introduction 
2. Bayesian nodes, pretrained RoBERTa model used in project - Give details on how 
you fine tuned it?

1. Asked to introduce myself. Post the intro I pitched my regression project and it turned out to be 
a good strategy. There was a detailed discussion based on the keywords mentioned in the resume 
such as multicollinearity, F and T Tests, their null and alternate hypothesis and their test statistic 
formula. The assumptions of regression. 
 
2. Asked about L1 regularization (picked from my project description) 
 
3. Asked in -detail about the working of Gradient boosting regressor (again, from my resume). How 
is it different compared to Random Forest? Why did it improve the performance? By doing basic 
EDA how do you determine if decision tree models are to be used? (If non-linearity is present in the 
data) 
 
4. Gave an easy puzzle and asked about a project from Work Ex (Analysing Router messages). 
 
Round 2:  
 
~30 minutes 
 
1. Asked for my introduction and I also pitched about the Regression project done. 
 
2. Asked to explain the working of Gradient Boosting Regressor in simple terms. 
 
3. She asked about PCA and K-means clustering algorithms. 
 
4. Two prisoners in different cells where they can't communicate with each other, had to toss two 
coins and guess what the other prisoner got. If at least one of them is correct, then they will be 
released. What strategy do they need to follow? (Ans: This is not possible) 
 
5. Since I had a restaurant recommender system project, the interviewer gave a guesstimate to 
estimate the revenue and factors affecting the profitability of a popular restaurant.

1. This was mostly a team fit round. It was online and there were 4 panellists, and they introduced 
themselves first and then asked me to introduce and talk about one of my proud moments.  
 
2. Then asked about my hobbies and the place where I am from.  
 
3. They asked about a project from my work ex and there were follow-up questions like what the 
business use case is etc. 
 
 
Srivatsa’s Preparation Strategy: I had prepared a One Note Page for each project, and I used to 
brainstorm different questions for each of my projects. In the last 10-15 days, I used to revise my CV 
every day. I focused on DL only in the last 10-15 days. Form a group of 3-4 people and have dedicated 
case discussion sessions. Develop a good understanding of how businesses run, how they make 
money, etc. I used ISLR, StatQuest, ChatGPT (Ask ChatGPT questions like “Explain to a 10-year
old how Gradient Boosting works.”), Stack Overflow (for questions specific to my profile). Be 
thorough with probability, hypothesis testing, Bayesian inference and Graphs (last 2 for 
Providence). Practise doing EDA using SQL

Coding Round: Coding + basic aptitude test. General coding questions, 2-D matrix puzzle 
requiring traversal using coordinate manipulation, etc. They were proper coding questions, not Data 
Science coding questions 
 
There were 2 main coding questions, 1 was very long and tough (2-D matrix, queen in the corner, 
you need to save her types), the other not so much (don't recall the 2nd questions) 
 
1 section on general aptitude (probability, etc.) and 1 section of Maths aptitude (basic class 9-10 level 
geometry, algebra questions.  
 
Total time was 40-45 minutes. I could solve 6-7 in Maths/10, 10/20 in general aptitude and half of 
the 2nd question in the coding round (it passed some cases, not all of them).

11 students were shortlisted via this coding round 
 
Interview Round 1: 
 
Technical Round 
 
They went through the CV, traversed through the key words. They asked if I had done any project 
on time series. I had done 2 projects, using LSTM in one. They asked: "What LSTM, how does 
LSTM work, what's the advantage of SVM over Logistic Regression (support vectors are robust to 
outliers and they depend only on the points inside the margin and immune to outside point, but we 
do need good amount of data for proper training), what's TF-IDF, what's the use of TF-IDF, what 
information does it convey?" They were asking basic questions, and didn't dive deep into the 
concepts, particularly in Deep Learning. 
 
Few python questions: "If you copy a dataframe, is the whole dataframe copied in python (i didn't 
know about python, but knew that there are copy by value and copy be reference values therein. I 
made an answer accordingly). What's deep copying and shallow copying in python (I didn't know 
this) 
 
Probability question: "You have some coins, 20 of them are heads, what can you do to ensure that 
half turn heads and half of them turn tails." It was a Geeks for Geeks puzzle (trick was something like 
flip 50% of the coins). I couldn't answer it. Thenthey asked: "There are 3 washrooms, one is occupied 
30% of the time, other is 20% of the time. If you could use a washroom, what's the probability that 
it’s the 1st one?" (Bayes' rule question).  
 
No business question was asked 
 
Interview Round 2:  
 
HR Round 
 
What do you expect from this role (I referred to their pre-placement talks and projects discussed 
there to answer this question), why JPMC, why are you fit for this role (pre-prepared answer, 1-2 
lines about JPMC being the oldest brand, interest in working BFSI sector), what other interviews 
did you sit for (I said DE Shaw, since I was interested in finance)? 
JP Morgan Chase 
 
 
 
 
113 
113 
 
My interview was decent and I converted, they were listening to my answers and didn't ask too many 
questions in between 
 
Ayushman’s Preparation Strategy: I started in July break. ISLR for classification, regression, 
SVM, etc. Then I prepared some of my projects thoroughly (anticipating their questions) 
 
I tried to read on the details of the concepts used in my projects in the last 10-15 days 
 
For case studies, IIM A, FMS, etc. case study books. I used the internet (including ChatGPT) for 
Deep Learning. I revised the 1st 4-5 chapters of Sheldon Ross for probability.  
 
Prepare DL topics well. PPTs are very important in placement case competitions, particularly for 
consulting roles. DO NOT bluff in your CVs randomly

4. Diwakar 
15 shortlist for interviews, 2 panels (One panel is going like a stress interview) 
 
 
Interview round 1: 
 
1. What is the difference between correlation and covariance? 
2. What is i.i.d, its assumption? 
3. Case: there is a banking firm, when a user complains on a fraud transaction if the 
fraud amount is less than $5, they’re simply paying the amount to the customer, for 
the greater amounts they escalate the issue and taking actions. They noticed that the 
fraud complaints cases with amounts less than $5 are increasing and the bank is 
paying much. What will be your work around this to solve the matter? 
4. (He asked if he can get the data of customers reporting these complaints, they said 
the firm won’t disclose it. They were expecting a business solution not an analytical 
one) 
5. For some ppl, they asked to explain the case given in shortlisting round ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Mukul Mundle (B.Tech + M.Tech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kanpur, graduated in 
2018. Worked for 3 years as Assistant Manager - Digital Transformation at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratory. 
Thereafter, worked for 1 year as Business Strategy Manager - Digital Excellence at Jubilant Group) 
 
 Pre-Interview Case Study: They had given a case study prior to the interview. We had 3 days' 
time. It was an individual case study. I was given Covid deaths dataset for four for 5-6 months 
countries based on which, I had to predict covid deaths for the next month. So a time series problem 
 
I used exogenous variables like covid cases, hospitalisation, stringency index, level of control by 
different governments for this case study 
 
Submission required a ppt and well made code notebook 
 
Round 1:  
 
They asked "What's bias-variance tradeoff, what's overfitting and underfitting?" (general question, 
not picked from my resume) 
 
They gave a case study where we had a median company (like Star Sports or Sony) as our client and 
they had to bid for a cricket tournament scheduled in 2028 (5 yrs down the line). We had to suggest 
a bid price. So it was a profitability kind of case study. My approach was to find the break-even price 
first. First of all, we had to identify the sources of revenue from the tournament - share of ticket 
prices, advertisements, merchandising, etc. When I mentioned these revenue sources, I was given 
revenue values for each of these sources. Then I moved to expenses - infrastructure (IT). He shared 
the corresponding value. Based on these, we can calculate profit after 2028, which we had to 
discount to 2023 (time value of money, he gave the interest rate too). That would be our bid price. 
Interviewer seemed pretty much convinced with my answer 
 
He had also asked a simple python question, and asked me to solve it without pandas (I can;t exactly 
recall it) 
 
Round 2:  
 
They started with my introduction, and then asked about one of my work experience projects: It 
was a data science project on pharmaceutical industry, where we wanted a good yield of the products. 
Oliver Wyman 
 
 
 
 
120 
120 
In the manufacturing setup we'd have different unit operations' initially we'd use certain raw 
materials - active pharmaceutical ingredients, supporting ingredients - and finally we'd get the tablet. 
Yield is output/input, and we had to maximize yield. Since these raw materials are going through 
different unit operations, there are different parameters included in this product supply chain, 
parameters like material attributes, process attributes, human attributes (which person is operating 
which machine, temperature and pressure of the machines, etc.), quality parameters. This was 
basically a regression problem. I explained the data sources, different variables involved in this 
problem statement and how I approached this problem statement. They asked questions on 
performance metrics and outcomes of this project. 
 
Then they moved to a case study: There's a case study about an existing sports store in a sports arena, 
and another sports store had to be opened in another part of the city. Interviewers had given me 
information about the customers of existing stores, when they were visiting the store, % of women 
and student customers. We want to open a store near a different spots arena, and market the same 
using pamphlets. Which section of the population should these pamphlets be distributed to? My 
approach: I started with questions on different types of customers visiting the existing store. I 
provided a solution from the RFM point of view. Idea is that we can bucket overall customers into 
buckets of users who are visiting recently, frequently, their monetary value and we can cluster users 
of existing store based on RFM technique, and we can apply learnings therefrom into the new store. 
Besides, we can do some kind of Porter's Five Force Analysis for the new store which we are opening - no. of competitors in that particular area, behaviour of customers visiting that area, etc. Post doing 
all these analyses and clustering (using RFM), we can distribute pamphlets to the most promising 
set of customers. 
 
I had mentioned in my CV that I was into adventure sports, so they asked a generic question related 
to that. 
 
[When I was done with this round, I was told that I had prepared very well for this round. However, 
I feel I was judged on the case study asked here and hence not selected] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from NIT Trichy, graduated in 2019. Worked for 18 months as 
Engineer - Product Development at Mahindra Research Valley) 
 
Pre-interview Case Study: Time-Series Forecasting on COVID-19 Deaths. [ PPT+ Code 
Submission] 
 
Time given: 5 days . Individually done, used  ARMA  & XGBoost 
 
Focus on Data Pre-processing, features for modelling and the slides (PPT) should be more visual 
than text with business implications than just model.  
 
Round 1:  
 
Technical Interview- Focused only on projects and in-depth understanding of highlighted terms in 
resume.  
 
Few Questions: 
 
What is the significance of doing PCA in K-means clustering? My Answer: PCA is used for 
dimensionality reduction 
What are the consequences for explainability? My Answer: PCA takes a linear combo of features 
and gives a new feature, but it's not easy to interpret. So that's the problem. New features should be 
interpretable 
 
How is XG-Boost different from normal gradient boosting? : Standard answer 
 
How do you decide when to ridge or lasso regression? My Answer: Lasso for feature selection & 
ridge for too much multicollinearity. OW didn't go deep 
 
Given a chance again, what additional features would you use for modelling this problem? 
(applicable to any project) : asked wrt a project. Told them additional features 
 
Round 2:  
 
Oliver Wyman 
 
 
 
 
122 
122 
Case Study Round: A business case on customer targeting strategy for a sports company was 
provided and the candidate is judged based on understanding of the business-problem, breaking it 
down and approach of moving towards a solution : It was more of a business case study -> kids come 
to buy sports equipment at a sports shop near a playground. How do you know which customers to 
give discount coupons to? -> Ask about the profile of the customers, who's buying more, seasonality, 
just get more information. Didn't get into any analytics 
 
Asked about my Favourite project : They wanted to check how excited I was wrt my projects and 
was there any genuinity. I explained it very well (it was from EXL case comp) 
 
Questions about the Case competition : What features did you use? Why do you think you made it 
to the final round? Why didn't you win ? My Answer: Be honest, others were better at presenting, 
etc.  
 
Suggestion: Ask clarifying questions. Do not jump right into the ML Modelling  aspect directly.  
 
 
Understanding of business aspects of data science, Machine Learning concepts and Statistical 
Methods are important . Effective communication is crucial, so focus on that as well.  
 
Aravintha’s Preparation Strategy: I prepared for my interviews during our academic break in the 
third semester at IIM-Calcutta. 
 
Recommended Materials: 
1. ISLR book and Paul Martin's summary notes 
2. Business Analytics :The Science of Data-Driven Decision Making by U Dinesh Kumar for 
chapters on Hypothesis Testing, Logistic Regression.  
3. Jay Alammar for BERT, Transformers topics 
4. Medium blogs for highlighted key terms of your resume projects. 
 
Important Topics: Regression, Decision Trees, Boosting, NLP, Clustering, Statistics & Probability 
 
General Tip: 
Write a simple resume with projects you feel confident about talking about in an interview, rather 
than throwing complex technical jargons.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Round 1:  
 
Difference between bagging and boosting, What is correlation, name a structure which can be 
correlated and have 0 value for correlation(circle). Puzzle, case study.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
9. Srivatsa Kulkarni (BE in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from BITS Pilani, 
graduated in 2019. Worked for 3 years as a Project Engineer at Wipro. Got to work on basic data 
related projects, involving things like EDA and outlier detection, for a year ) 
 
Pre-Interview Case Study: Time series based Covid deaths prediction for 4 countries. Approach: 
Get the variables that will help predict deaths (I created few lag variables & exogenous variables - 
such as occupied ICU beds; I also used ChatGPT to brainstorm these features). Then I did basic 
EDA and plots, then my baseline model was linear regression and then XGBoost. I also used Shapley 
plots to interpret the features. However, my business recommendations were bad (I didn’t properly 
think them through) 
 
Round 1:  
 
1. Introduce yourself and then they picked up one of the case competitions and asked about the 
business problem and features involved. They asked about feature engineering we had done and to 
develop at least one new feature using existing ones. There were no questions regarding ML models 
used. 
 
2. They asked me to explain the classification project, features used, what is IQR?  
 
3. Asked to explain my recommender system project. They questioned a lot on how does Alternating 
Least Squares based matrix factorization solve the cold start problem. I felt the panel was not very 
much convinced with my answers but they kept on questioning me. 
 
Oliver Wyman 
 
 
 
 
124 
124 
4. Customer segmentation project. Asked to explain PCA and what are the specific insights 
generated using it. They were expecting in-depth analysis using PCA and more on business insights. 
The panel was very critically assessing the answers given and there were lots of counter questions 
 
Be very thorough with the projects and case comp written in your resume. For me the panel asked  
questions from projects aligned more towards business such as segmentation and Recommender 
System.

Round 1: 
 
 ~20 minutes 
 
1. Asked to introduce myself. I pitched my regression project as well (I wanted to drive the interview 
towards my regression project, since it’s easier. Hence, I used to mention my regression project in 
my introduction) 
 
2. Based on the project he asked various questions about F and T test. Asked about their null and 
alternate hypothesis. 
 
3. Probability of an accident in any given hour is 1/2. What is the probability of an accident in any 
30 minute window?

Resume shortlisting and a test was held. Test included a guesstimate. 
(The guesstimate was to calculate average sleep hours for a society) 
 
 
 INTERVIEW Round 1: 
1. It was a Case Study Round: 
2. Case was:  
You are working for a client which is a US based firm 'Quick Loans'. They 
provide installment home loans. You have to help in setting the price (the 
rate of interest) 
3. Initially very little information is provided. In such cases you have to build 
up by asking the right question to extract that information from the 
interviewer and then using a structured approach arrive at an actionable 
solution for the client. 
4. After I provided my solution , 
Q. If you have to decide between two rates of interest for this how would 
you approach? 
5. Comparing two situations what factors do you take into account and the 
importance that you give them was probably evaluated here

5. Mukul Mundle [Converted] 
 
(B.Tech + M.Tech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kanpur, graduated in 2018. Worked for 3 
years as Assistant Manager - Digital Transformation at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratory. Thereafter, worked 
for 1 year as Business Strategy Manager - Digital Excellence at Jubilant Group) 
 
Round 1:  
 
They asked questions mostly on work experience. Since my work experience was similar to the role 
offered here, these questions were very relevant 
 
They asked what different kinds of projects I had done while working with DRL, what kinds of 
challenges I had faced, and any kind of operations/manufacturing issue related to different 
stakeholders that I had handled.  
 
Since this role required reporting to the CEO/MD, there was some general conversation along these 
lines. They asked some questions to check my knowledge of the pharmaceutical sector. I explained 
about different pharmaceutical unit operations during the interview. There were questions on 
conflict management too (since this role required interaction with senior management). [I answered 
that I was in similar situations and similar roles in my previous companies, hence I was aware how 
to deal with such scenarios] 
 
Round 2:  
 
This round seemed more like a formality, since they had probably already made up their mind to 
select me. They asked questions like "Tell us something about your family, who all are there in your 
family, where is your sister studying, etc." 
 
Mukuls’s Preparation Strategy: I would suggest preparing a small group of ~3-4 guys. I had made 
a group with 2 other students, and we used to discuss different topics and case studies. Once we came 
to IIM, we made this group and started preparing for this interview. IIM A, B, C casebooks are good 
resources to prepare for case studies. ISLR is also a good source ( I had read the summary of ISLR 
actually!). UDK is also a really good book (better than ISLR imo). Towards DataScience and 
Medium articles are very helpful (preferably take tds subscription). Use ChatGPT for clarifying 
different algorithms, prepare HR questions' answers.

They were asking random questions (not based on our CV) 
 
What's a bias-variance tradeoff? Then, they gave some information on customers and relations with 
different customers, and I approached this problem statement using graphs. He then asked me to 
write the python code for my solution on paper (basically we had several numbers and they were 
connected with each other. I had to find the maximum number connected to each number). I used 
2 for loops to write the python code. 
 
They asked me to calculate 396*47, without using pen and paper. I approached it as (400-3)*(50-4), 
and gave the correct answer.  
 
Round 2:  
 
Started with my introduction. Then they asked me about one of my work experience projects: It was 
a data science project in the pharmaceutical industry, where we wanted a good yield of the products. 
In the manufacturing setup we'd have different unit operations' initially we'd use certain raw 
materials - active pharmaceutical ingredients, supporting ingredients - and finally we'd get the tablet. 
Yield is output/input, and we had to maximize yield. Since these raw materials are going through 
different unit operations, there are different parameters included in this product supply chain, 
parameters like material attributes, process attributes, human attributes (which person is operating 
which machine, temperature and pressure of the machines, etc.), and quality parameters. This was 
basically a regression problem. I explained the data sources, different variables involved in this 
problem statement and how I approached this problem statement. While I was explaining my 
project, they asked questions on various ML techniques: "What's random forest, what's a decision 
tree, what's XGBoost, etc?" I explained that I had used Shapley values and the related feature 
engineering part of my project. 
 
They asked "Why Accenture?" I answered that I already had experience in the analytics field and I 
wanted to work in a similar environment, since I was working effectively as an internal consultant 
and providing analytics solutions. Accenture would give me an opportunity to interact with external 
clients, thereby being a natural work progression.  
 
They enquired about my interest in adventure sports, and hobbies in general. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Vivekananda Chaudhary [Joined]:  
There were 2 online rounds for EXL.  
Interview Round 1: 
1. The first round was about 15-20 minutes and it started with HR questions like introduction, 
about my previous work experience. Then the 2 panelists gave me Sql problem (moderate 
level) which could be solved using self join - I dont remember the exact question 
2. Then they gave a probability question that could be solved using bayes theorem. If I 
remember correctly, the question was that a couple had 3 children. What is the probability 
of having 2 boys given that the elder was a boy or something. 
3. Then they asked me some basic ML and python pandas and numpy questions. In ML, 
they asked me about classification errors. 
That was about it in the first round.  
If we have decent workex, they will go deeply in the work ex points mentioned in the CV. 
 
Interview Round 2: 
1. In the second round, the selection was based on 1 case study question, common to all the 3 
remaining candidates including me. You are a Marketing Analyst in ABC bank. You have 
the email addresses of 1000 potential credit card customers. How to form suitable targeted 
marketing promotion campaign for maximum conversion? 
2. Tip - Communicate your approach at regular intervals to the panelist (there was a single 
panelist in the second round as opposed to 2 panelists in the first round). Ask questions in 
between to the panelists to ensure the correct direction of thr case study. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The third round was taken by MD. 
 
Interview Round 1: 
 
The interview was heavily focused around Deep Learning projects. I had BERT project on my  
resume. 
1. I was asked about tokenization in BERT, explain how a word piece tokenizer works (on paper). 
What  are the other kinds of tokenizer that can be used? 
2)How can you get output from all 12 hidden states(encoders) ? 
3)Questions around architecture of BERT. Follow-up questions on that. How do you train a BERT 
for a  
4)Question Answering task? Explain the steps involved 
5)How is Sentiment analysis done using bert?Explain the steps involved.(I told the max pooling and 
CLS based approach) 
6)Why do we use skip connections(Often due to vanishing gradient the entire layers below a certain 
layer will not learn anything. In order to prevent this skip connections helps provide information 
flow through alternate channel, to bottom layers hence improving learning for the network) 
7)If it is not stationary, what problems can occur in AR/ARIMA/SARIMA modeling?(If it is not 
stationary, then the variance is not constant, which means prediction intervals, confidence intervals, 
and the entire analysis will be inaccurate. Moreover, if the expected value is not constant, some 
predictions will also be incorrect.) 
8)Word2Vec and it's type 
9)What is Glove and when do we use it.
